                    We are the Red's LABRATSâ€”a name that reflects our curiosity, creativity, and experimental spirit. 
                    Though we come from diverse disciplines within the STEAM field, our shared scientific mindset drives 
                    us to research deeply and contribute meaningfully to this topic.

                <p>
                  This project is supported by a researcher from the <strong>Monash Institute of Medical Engineering (MIME)</strong>,
                  a collaborative initiative that brings together expertise from medicine, engineering, IT, and design. In partnership
                  with Monash Partners, MIME works closely with clinicians to address real-world health challenges by supporting
                  research, education, and the commercialisation of innovative medical technologies.
