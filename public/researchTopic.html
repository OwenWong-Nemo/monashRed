            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
              Sudden Unexpected Death in Infancy (SUDI) is a tragic and complex phenomenon that continues to impact families worldwide. While many deaths are preventable through safe sleep practices, not all families have equal access to the knowledge, resources, or culturally appropriate support to implement those practices.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project investigates how technology, particularly a thoughtfully designed infant sleeping device, could support safer sleep environments across diverse communities.

            <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
            <p>
              Many SUDI-prevention tools and guidelines follow a one-size-fits-all model. Yet, families differ in living conditions, cultural norms, and their trust in healthcare or technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we fail to design for inclusion and equity, we risk leaving behind the most vulnerable communities — the very families that may benefit the most from innovation and education.
