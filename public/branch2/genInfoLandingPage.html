        <p>Explore the facts, figures, and scientific rationale behind our project. This section is designed to give you a
          deeper understanding of <strong>Sudden Unexpected Death in Infancy (SUDI)</strong> — what it is, why awareness
          matters, and the data that drives our mission.</p>
        <p>By expanding the sections below, you’ll learn:</p>

        <div class="collapsible-body">
          <p><strong>Sudden Unexpected Death in Infancy (SUDI)</strong> is a broad term used when an infant dies
            suddenly and unexpectedly, and the cause of death is not immediately obvious. It includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome):</strong> when no cause of death can be found, even after
              thorough investigation.</li>
            <li><strong>Fatal sleep accidents:</strong> such as suffocation or entrapment while sleeping.</li>
            <li><strong>Other sudden deaths:</strong> like undiagnosed infections or medical conditions.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These tragedies usually occur during sleep and often affect seemingly healthy babies. Because the cause is
            not immediately known, a full investigation including an autopsy, review of the medical history, and
            examination of the sleep environment is usually required.</p>
          <p>SUDI is not a single condition but a classification that underscores the importance of both medical
            evaluation and environmental safety.</p>

          <h3>SUDI Statistics</h3>
          <span class="arrow">&#9662;</span>
        </div>
        <div class="collapsible-body">
          <p>Understanding the data behind SUDI can help identify high-risk groups and guide prevention efforts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Most cases occur between 2–4 months of age, but babies can be affected as early as the first few days
              and up to 12 months old.</li>
            <li>Premature or low birth weight infants are significantly more vulnerable due to their underdeveloped
              systems.</li>
            <li>Unwell infants, especially those with respiratory or neurological issues, may face increased risk during
              sleep.</li>
            <li>Gender disparity exists — approximately 60% of SUDI cases involve male infants, though the reasons are
              not fully understood.</li>
            <li>The majority of deaths occur during sleep, particularly overnight or in the early morning hours.</li>
            <li>Unsafe sleeping practices such as co-sleeping without safeguards, placing babies on their stomach, or
              exposure to smoke are frequently involved.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These statistics reinforce the importance of public education and culturally appropriate support,
            especially for vulnerable families.</p>

          <h3>Why SUDI Awareness Matters</h3>
          <span class="arrow">&#9662;</span>
        </div>
        <div class="collapsible-body">
          <p>Raising awareness about SUDI has life-saving potential. Here's why it is so crucial:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Disproportionate impact:</strong> SUDI remains a significant public health concern, particularly
              among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Addressing cultural, socioeconomic, and access
              barriers is essential in reducing these disparities.</li>
            <li><strong>Preventability:</strong> Many SUDI deaths are preventable through simple and practical changes
              to a baby’s sleep environment — such as placing babies on their back to sleep, removing soft bedding, and
              avoiding overheating.</li>
            <li><strong>Informed choices:</strong> When families understand the risks, they are better equipped to
              create safer sleep spaces and advocate for their baby’s wellbeing.</li>
            <li><strong>Support for grieving families:</strong> Knowing they’re not alone and that others have
              experienced similar tragedies can provide comfort. Community awareness helps reduce stigma and fosters
              compassion.</li>
            <li><strong>Empowered professionals:</strong> Midwives, health visitors, and early childhood workers can use
              this knowledge to educate and guide families — especially in high-risk groups.</li>
          </ul>
