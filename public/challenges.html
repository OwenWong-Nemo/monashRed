                <h1>Challenges</h1>
                <p>We face several critical challenges in our mission to develop a culturally respectful, widely adopted, and practical solution to prevent SUDI.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>Cultural Differences in Infant Sleep Practices</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Infant sleep traditions vary greatly across communities — from co-sleeping to cradle use.</li>
                    <li>Some families may resist devices that challenge generational knowledge or customs.</li>
                    <li>We must respect these differences while maintaining safety standards.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>Stigma Around Medical or Assistive Devices</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Parents may feel judged for needing a sleep-monitoring product.</li>
                    <li>Devices that appear too clinical could cause anxiety or feel out of place in the home.</li>
                    <li>We're committed to designing tools that feel supportive, not alarming.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>Adoption & Usability Barriers</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Affordability and access can be limiting, especially in underserved regions.</li>
                    <li>Complex or tech-heavy designs may overwhelm new parents.</li>
                    <li>Trust must be earned through thoughtful design and community endorsement.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>Communication & Education Gaps</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Many people still don’t understand what SUDI is or how it occurs.</li>
                    <li>Our messaging must be simple, consistent, and culturally sensitive.</li>
                    <li>Multilingual resources and accessible design are key to reaching all families.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>Regulatory and Ethical Hurdles</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>If classified as a medical device, extra certifications may be needed.</li>
                    <li>Any data collected must be stored ethically and securely.</li>
                    <li>We must market ethically without exploiting fear.</li>
